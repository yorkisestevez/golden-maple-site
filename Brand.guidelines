Purpose of This Document

This document outlines why the AntiGravity website is changing, what those changes represent, and how they intentionally reflect the direction of the business. The website is no longer a general marketing tool—it is a strategic filter, positioning asset, and operational support system for premium growth.

Why the Website Is Changing

The AntiGravity website is no longer designed to attract volume.
It is being rebuilt to attract alignment.

As the business evolves, the website must reflect:

The caliber of work we deliver

The level of investment our projects require

The seriousness and preparedness of our ideal clients

The previous version of the website allowed too many low-fit inquiries, unclear expectations, and unproductive conversations. The new version is designed to prevent that—politely, confidently, and professionally.

Core Business Intent

The new website exists to:

Attract fewer, higher-quality inquiries

Pre-qualify budget, timing, and decision readiness

Protect design time and reduce unnecessary site visits

Reinforce AntiGravity as a premium, design-led contractor

Align marketing with real capacity, margins, and revenue goals

This is not about exclusivity for ego—it is about sustainability, clarity, and mutual respect.

Key Website Changes
1. Clear Minimum Project Investment

The website now clearly communicates a $25,000+ minimum project investment.
This sets expectations early and avoids uncomfortable conversations later.

2. Structured Project Intake

Casual contact forms are replaced with a structured intake process that gathers:

Project type

Budget range

Timeline

Decision-maker alignment

Photos and problem statements

This ensures conversations start informed and productive.

3. Budget-Gated Booking

Calendly access is no longer open.
Only projects that meet the minimum investment threshold are invited to book a call.

This protects time, improves close rates, and reinforces value.

4. Early Design Retainer Positioning

A $1,500 design retainer is introduced early in the process—not as a sales tactic, but as a clarity tool.
Clients understand that planning, design, and expertise have value before construction begins.

5. Messaging Shift

Copy now emphasizes:

Transformation over transactions

Longevity over speed

Process over price

This aligns the website with how AntiGravity actually works on real projects.

How This Reflects on the Business

These changes intentionally signal that AntiGravity:

Operates with confidence and professionalism

Is selective, not desperate for volume

Values long-term outcomes over quick wins

Functions as a partner, not a commodity contractor

Respects both the client’s investment and its own expertise

The website now reflects the business we are building—not the one we are trying to grow out of.

Client Experience Going Forward

From the first interaction, clients experience clarity.

They understand:

Typical investment ranges

The design-build process

What happens next

What is required to move forward

By the time a call happens, both sides are aligned.
Conversations are shorter, more productive, and more decisive.

Long-Term Impact

Over time, this website strategy will lead to:

Higher average project values

Shorter sales cycles

Better client relationships

Stronger brand perception

More predictable scheduling and cash flow

Less burnout and fewer wasted site visits

Closing Statement

This website strategy represents a deliberate shift toward premium, sustainable growth.

AntiGravity is not trying to work with everyone.
It is building a business that is selective, respected, and profitable—supported by a website that does the same work before the first conversation ever begins.
