CORE PRINCIPLE

The website must be designed mobile-first, then enhanced for desktop — never the other way around.

Assume:

First visit = phone

First impression = mobile

Decision to continue = made in under 5 seconds

If it does not feel calm, clear, and intentional on mobile, it is not acceptable.

MOBILE UX RULES (MANDATORY)
1. LAYOUT & SPACING

Single-column layouts only on mobile

No side-by-side sections below 1024px

Generous vertical spacing between sections

Tap targets must be large and forgiving

Minimum standards:

Buttons: 44px+ height

Section padding: minimum 24–32px

Line height: 1.4–1.6

2. TYPOGRAPHY

Headlines must never wrap awkwardly

No forced line breaks in headings

Avoid long headlines that become 3–4 lines on mobile

Body text must remain readable without zoom

Mobile font guidance:

Headline base: ~26–32px

Body text: ~16–18px

Labels/helper text: ~14–15px

3. HERO SECTION (CRITICAL)

Hero text must be fully readable without scrolling

Text must never sit over busy image areas

Overlay strength must be adjusted for mobile if needed

CTA must be visible immediately (no scrolling)

Rules:

One headline

One optional subheadline

One CTA only

No secondary buttons on mobile hero

4. IMAGES ON MOBILE

Crop images specifically for mobile (do not rely on auto-resize)

Prioritize center-weighted compositions

Avoid tall images that push content too far down

No image carousels on mobile

Image rules:

Max 1 image above the fold

No stacked images

Lazy-load all below-the-fold images

5. NAVIGATION (MOBILE)

Clean hamburger menu only

Primary CTA (“Start Your Project”) must be visible and tappable

No dropdown-heavy navigation

No phone numbers or clutter in header

Menu order (top to bottom):

Services

Our Process

About

Start Your Project (CTA-styled)

6. FORMS (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT)

Forms must feel effortless on mobile

One field per row

Large input fields

Clear labels above fields (not placeholders only)

Rules:

No multi-column forms on mobile

No dense text near form fields

Budget/timeline selections must be thumb-friendly

Submit button must span full width

Button text:
Continue to Next Step

7. SCROLL EXPERIENCE

Content should guide the thumb naturally

No sudden visual jumps

Avoid long unbroken text blocks

Use visual rhythm: text → space → image → space → text

The site should feel:

Calm, paced, and intentional — never crowded.

8. PERFORMANCE & FEEL

Fast load on mobile networks

No heavy animations

No auto-playing video on mobile

Transitions must feel subtle and deliberate

If performance or clarity suffers → remove the effect.

MOBILE QUALITY CHECK (MANDATORY)

Before finalizing any page, answer YES to all:

Can this page be understood in under 10 seconds on a phone?

Is the primary CTA visible without scrolling?

Does nothing feel cramped or rushed?

Would removing one element improve clarity?

If any answer is NO → revise.

FINAL MOBILE DIRECTIVE

Golden Maple Landscaping must feel considered, professional, and trustworthy on mobile — not compressed, not salesy, not busy.

Mobile is not a smaller desktop.
It is the primary experience.

Proceed accordingly.
